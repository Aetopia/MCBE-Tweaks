## Alternatives

* If you're getting a lot of virus detection messages, you might want to use an ["Obfuscated Version Of The Onix Launcher"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bernarddesfosse/onixclientautoupdate/main/OnixLauncher_E.exe).

* If you want to build the launcher yourself feel free to [view their GitHub Repository](https://github.com/notcarlton/OnixLauncher).

* If you wish to use any other injector then you can use [Fate Injector](https://github.com/fligger/FateInjector/releases/latest/download/FateInjector.exe).
